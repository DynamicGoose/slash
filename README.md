# Slash

**Disclaimer:** Slash is in **very** early developement. You can have a look at the Roadmap for what's to come.

Slash is an app for managing music across different streaming providers. The way this works is through a plugin system, where a plugin interacts with the public api of the streaming service for things like search or streaming audio.
